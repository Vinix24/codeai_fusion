0.08 : it took me 365 days to make $500,000
4.24 : with this faceless YouTube channel yeah
6.799 : so when I started this channel I was a
8.48 : broke high school student with $120 to
11.36 : my name today 365 days later I make a
15.32 : full-time income from my faceless
17.08 : channels travel the world and work from
19.24 : absolutely anywhere in the world all
21.32 : thanks to YouTube automation for this
23.519 : video I've gathered all my YouTube
25.279 : knowledge into a full in-depth 1hour
28.199 : plus course that will teach you how to
29.599 : start your your own monetizable faceless
31.679 : Channel with AI after watching this
33.76 : video you'll have the entire blueprint I
35.719 : used to go from $0 to
38.6 : $150,000 a month I will go through
41.48 : everything from how to find good topics
43.719 : write engaging scripts generate a voice
46.239 : over design your own character create
48.8 : visuals editing and even how to monetize
51.399 : your channel and no I'm not talking
53.44 : about ad Revenue I'm talking about a
55.6 : brand new way to monetize faceless
57.719 : channels that I've never heard anyone
59.519 : talk about before to make things easy
61.519 : for you to follow I will break down a
63.359 : niche that has gone absolutely viral in
66.0 : the last couple of months channels in
68.119 : this Niche are to this day getting
69.88 : millions of views and make well over 10K
72.2 : a month the craziest part is that their
74.439 : videos are created entirely with AI the
77.6 : niche I'm talking about is the history
79.4 : Niche it's kind of a broad Niche I know
82.479 : I want to leave some room for
83.759 : imagination so that you can Implement
85.68 : what you'll learn in this video and
87.119 : start your own unique Channel anyways
89.92 : these channels are creating longer
91.64 : documentary style videos about
93.36 : historical events like the Roman Empire
95.64 : or World War II this channel for example
98.399 : called beginning to now is bringing in
100.24 : around
101.36 : $4,500 just from ad revenue and in
104.0 : reality it's a lot more than that when
105.96 : counting in all of their other income
107.64 : sources before you get too excited
109.92 : though I just have to say that YouTube
111.88 : does require 1,000 subscribers and 4,000
114.96 : hours of watch time to monetize your
116.84 : channel which can be a real pain in the
118.439 : ass as you're starting out if you want
120.2 : to skip the grind to 1,000 subscribers
122.399 : where you initially won't earn a dollar
124.32 : back there are websites like tick
125.96 : accounts where you can buy pre-
127.2 : monetized channels they're all organic
129.44 : and have a western audience meaning
131.039 : their RPM is as high as it can get so
133.36 : trust me the accounts do work usually it
136.28 : takes around 6 months to get a channel
138.2 : monetized but with these you can earn ad
140.519 : revenue on your first post so if you're
142.84 : in the market for such accounts feel
144.56 : free to use my code how to aai and
146.64 : they'll see that you came from my
147.84 : channel it actually helps out more than
149.4 : you think
150.519 : now before we get into the tutorial I
152.64 : just want to tell you that this is not
154.28 : one of those dopamine hitting High paste
156.519 : videos you're used to this will be a
158.599 : slower paced video with full
160.879 : transparency I'll show you absolutely
163.2 : everything from start to finish every
165.519 : button I press to create these videos
167.64 : I've studied all the most successful
169.319 : channels in this Niche and created a
171.2 : 13-step blueprint that I'll break down
173.519 : step by step for you guys if you follow
176.04 : all of these steps you will go from
178.2 : being a beginner to a YouTu tube
180.08 : automation expert first we're going to
182.68 : analyze our competition I've picked out
184.76 : some of the most successful channels in
186.48 : the historical Niche and done a full
188.239 : breakdown of their strategies and the
190.2 : main takeaways we can use when creating
192.159 : our own video I'll also show you how
194.519 : much these channels are making and all
196.56 : their income sources like ad Revenue
199.0 : affiliate marketing communities and all
201.239 : that stuff next we'll find a viral topic
203.92 : with AI in literally just a couple of
205.879 : minutes I've found this crazy AI
208.36 : software that analyzes other Channel's
210.439 : most viral videos and provides you with
212.959 : similar topics so stay tuned for that
215.36 : then we're going to use AI to generate a
217.4 : script and create a custom character
219.879 : next we'll create and animate visuals in
222.239 : Leonardo AI then before we get into the
224.64 : editing I'll show you how to find
226.28 : monetizable music after that we'll put
228.799 : it all together in cap cut and turn it
230.84 : into a Netflix style documentary once
233.519 : the video is ready I'll show you my
235.2 : step-by-step blueprint I use to create
237.68 : all my thumbnails then I'll show you
239.959 : what upload settings I use and how to
242.159 : optimize your video for SEO when we've
244.799 : posted the video I'll show you how you
246.56 : can monetize your channel and actually
248.56 : make money from it to make things easy
250.439 : for you I've created this document with
252.4 : all the steps and tools we'll be going
254.4 : through in this video it's basically a
256.32 : step-by-step checklist with all the
258.359 : steps that go into creating these videos
260.72 : so as we're creating this video I'll
262.72 : check these boxes to make sure we're not
264.52 : missing any steps I figured this would
266.72 : make it easier for you guys when
268.199 : creating these videos yourself I really
270.639 : suggest you get it because there's quite
272.28 : a lot of steps that go into this and it
274.32 : can get pretty confusing unless you have
276.28 : it all mapped out it's in the first
278.08 : welcome channel in my free community you
280.0 : can just join and grab it as you wish
282.12 : it's super simple and will take you no
284.12 : more than a minute to do however this is
286.68 : really where you'll find the most value
288.6 : if you want to take this seriously this
290.68 : is where me and my mentors are dropping
292.84 : the real sauce the stuff I can't fit
294.759 : into these videos on YouTube it's
296.639 : literally free value you won't find
298.479 : anywhere else for Absolut abolutely 0 so
301.12 : now that you have the document ready
302.68 : let's get into creating the actual
306.919 : video so as you can see the first step
309.84 : is obviously to create a channel to
312.4 : begin with you want to head over to
313.96 : YouTube and click on your profile
315.759 : picture then you want to hit switch
317.8 : account and you'll see all your active
319.8 : channels since we want to create a new
322.0 : one you want to click on view all
324.4 : channels you'll then be taken to this
326.6 : page where you want to press create new
328.56 : channel next you want to fill in this
330.44 : box with your username if you already
332.4 : have a name in mind just type it in here
334.52 : and hit create if not we can use AI to
337.68 : come up with one to do this you first
339.56 : want to head over to chat GPT then you
342.0 : want to copy this prompt that you'll
343.52 : find in the document and paste it into
345.68 : chat GPT I've already filled it in with
348.199 : my Niche and competitors but you can
350.039 : really use this prompt regardless of
351.8 : your Niche just switch the word history
354.0 : with your own Niche and the names of the
355.639 : competitors next you want to hit
357.44 : generate and it'll give you 10 name
359.16 : suggestions question to choose from I
361.12 : thought Legacy of Ages sounded really
363.039 : good so I'll just copy it and head back
364.84 : to YouTube and paste now you want to hit
367.16 : create and your channel will be ready
369.039 : but we can't really leave it like this
371.199 : so the next step is to customize our
373.52 : Channel with a description profile
375.88 : picture and all that stuff start off by
378.36 : clicking on customize Channel then you
380.84 : want to press basic info to the right
383.479 : and you'll be taken to this page where
385.199 : you can change your username and add a
387.4 : description first you want to add a
389.08 : handle this is basically your Channel's
391.12 : unique username and since it's Unique
393.319 : you can't have the same handle as any
394.96 : other channel so chances are high your
397.639 : username will already be taken by
399.4 : someone else in this case you just want
401.639 : to go with something as close as
403.319 : possible like adding an extra letter in
405.639 : this case I'll just add an extra s once
407.88 : you found one it's time to create a
409.72 : description with AI now you want to head
412.24 : back over to the document and copy this
414.68 : prompt and paste it into chat GPT we're
417.479 : basically telling it to generate an
419.039 : engaging description packed with
421.199 : keywords that will optimize our
422.879 : Channel's SEO and to keep it between 100
425.68 : to 150 words so just hit enter and it'll
428.68 : write the entire description for you I'd
430.72 : recommend you read it through and make
432.039 : sure everything looks good then you just
433.8 : want to copy the entire thing and paste
435.84 : it into YouTube now you want to head
437.759 : over to The Branding section here you'll
439.8 : be able to upload a profile picture
441.68 : which we're going to create right now to
443.479 : do this head back over to chat GPT and
446.319 : paste in this prompt that you'll find in
448.199 : the document if you're cre creating a
449.919 : channel in the history Niche you'll
451.72 : probably be able to use the same prompt
453.52 : I'm using otherwise just adjust it to
455.8 : whatever Niche your channel is in now
457.84 : hit generate and it'll give you a
459.319 : detailed description of the image but we
461.4 : can't really do much with this so ask it
463.44 : to turn the design idea into a text
465.56 : prompt this way we'll get a detailed
467.68 : prompt we can use in any AI image
469.879 : generator you want for this tutorial
472.159 : I'll use Leonardo AI since they have
474.159 : some crazy features we're going to use
475.96 : later on in the video and of course it's
478.28 : free if you're starting out but you can
480.039 : really go with any image generator out
482.199 : there like mid Journey which will
483.68 : probably give you a better result but at
485.639 : the same time it's expensive so once
487.599 : you're in the image generator make sure
489.479 : you have the aspect ratio set to 1 one
492.24 : this will make the image be in a square
493.759 : shape which is exactly what we want when
495.84 : creating a profile picture I also like
497.84 : to set the number of images to four so I
500.039 : have a couple of them to choose from
501.8 : next you want to copy the image prompt
503.56 : from chat GPT that you generated earlier
506.0 : and paste it into Leonardo hit generate
508.44 : and wait for the images to be created
510.56 : now pick the one you like best and
512.0 : download it then head back over to
514.2 : YouTube and upload it now lastly we need
517.479 : to optimize our Channel's SEO with
519.64 : keywords SEO stands for search engine
522.479 : optimization it's basically a way to
524.399 : make it easier for people to find our
526.44 : Channel Through Search keywords think
528.44 : about when you Google something the
530.0 : website that appears at the top or at
532.04 : least rank high without paid ads they
534.279 : have really good SEO Google wants to
537.04 : show their page in order for us to get
539.0 : the same results for our YouTube channel
541.16 : click on settings and go to the tab that
543.279 : says channel here you'll see a box where
545.36 : you can enter keywords related to your
547.16 : Niche to find keywords I like to use
549.64 : chat GPT and ask it to provide me with a
552.0 : list of keywords related to the history
553.92 : Niche now just copy each keyword and
556.44 : paste it into YouTube Once done with
558.68 : that you want to hit save and our
560.32 : channel is all
564.32 : set first you got to find competitors to
567.36 : do this I like to open up YouTube and
569.399 : incognito mode basically without being
571.6 : logged into an account then you want to
573.48 : search up main keywords in your niche in
576.0 : this case words like history and history
578.56 : documentary then you want to find the
580.32 : channels that get the most views a good
582.64 : sign is that there are lots of smaller
584.36 : channels pushing a lot of views let's
586.32 : say a Channel with 20K Subs that gets
589.16 : 100K plus views on multiple videos this
592.16 : means YouTube's pushing their videos to
594.2 : audiences outside of the subscribers so
597.32 : I found three channels that are creating
599.399 : videos in a similar Niche you'll find
601.2 : the link to all of them in the document
603.0 : the first channel is called voices of
605.04 : the past they have almost a million
607.16 : subscribers and 76 million views they're
610.32 : creating these really long history
612.36 : documentaries that consist of basically
614.56 : just images some text and a voiceover
617.36 : they don't have any character or
618.88 : anything like that and they don't even
620.399 : animate the images which is something
621.959 : I'll teach you how to do later on the
623.959 : second channel is this one called fire
625.92 : of learning they have quite a different
628.0 : style with a bit more editing but most
629.839 : of their videos are just images with a
631.68 : few transitions as you can see they're
634.04 : making a couple thousand a month from ad
636.16 : Revenue they also have this patreon page
638.68 : where they're charging anywhere from $1
640.279 : to $15 a month now lastly we have this
643.12 : channel called beginning to now they
645.279 : post these really long documentaries
647.44 : about historical events like the British
649.639 : and Persian Empire it's literally just
651.92 : what looks to be AI generated images and
654.2 : a voice over I really like the style of
656.32 : their videos so we'll take some
657.839 : inspiration from this channel once we
659.56 : start creating the video one thing
661.48 : they're really doing well is in their
663.399 : titles they're starting each title with
666.079 : the entire history of followed by the
668.36 : event the video is about this way
670.399 : they're branding their channel so that
671.88 : people know it's their video I figured
674.0 : we'll do something similar with our own
675.72 : video but more on that later as you can
677.839 : see some of their videos are up to 3
680.12 : hours long so it's safe to say they're
682.0 : making a good amount just from ad
683.6 : Revenue social blade says they're making
685.88 : 4K a month but I'd guess it's a lot more
688.6 : since their video are so long and
690.72 : they're actually not monetizing their
692.56 : channel in any way outside of AD Revenue
695.48 : later on in this video I'll show you
697.2 : guys three ways you can monetize a
699.24 : channel like this outside of AD Revenue
702.399 : now that we've got a better
703.639 : understanding of the competition it's
705.16 : time to get into the actual video
709.839 : creation so the first thing we got to do
712.519 : is to come up with a viral topic here's
714.92 : one important thing for you to take away
716.56 : from this video your topic is literally
719.0 : not 90% of the reason whether your video
721.639 : goes viral or not no one cares if you
724.04 : have the greatest quality and editing if
726.04 : your topic sucks and it goes the same
728.12 : way around a video with a great topic
730.68 : can go viral with terrible quality and
732.92 : editing if the topic interests people I
735.32 : see too many channels overlook this step
737.68 : and create videos on topics absolutely
740.44 : no one cares about and they all end up
742.48 : with no views at all since we're
744.76 : creating videos in the history Niche
746.92 : which is quite an evergreen Niche
748.519 : there's not really any Trends we got to
750.12 : take into account instead we can take
752.519 : inspiration from our competitors and
754.48 : their best performing videos let's take
756.8 : this channel we talked about earlier all
758.88 : of their best performing videos are
760.839 : about the entire history of the human
763.6 : civilization Egypt United Kingdom and so
766.68 : on each one of them is getting millions
768.959 : of views which tells us it's a proven
771.16 : concept so there's actually an easier
773.72 : way to find video topics using AI what
776.24 : you want to do is head over to this
777.92 : website called tube magic you'll find
780.079 : the link to it in the document we're
781.8 : going to use this tool not only to find
783.76 : a viral topic but also to generate our
786.519 : script once you've signed up for an
788.36 : account you want to click on video idea
791.04 : and here we're going to paste the link
792.48 : of one of our competitors so just copy
794.639 : the link from YouTube and paste it the
796.68 : AI will then analyze all their most
799.12 : popular videos and give you a similar
801.48 : topic now hit generate and it'll give
803.519 : you a couple of video topic suggestions
805.92 : if you press generate again it'll come
807.72 : up with a new topic so do this a couple
809.72 : of times until you get one you like as
811.959 : you can see it uses the exact same the
814.519 : entire history of Structure as they do
816.88 : on their videos now once you picked a
818.88 : topic you want to hit generate script
821.04 : I'll go with the entire history of Japan
823.6 : you can also use this bar to choose how
825.8 : long you want the script to be since
827.839 : this is a tutorial and I don't want to
829.399 : bore you guys out I'll set it to 800
831.519 : words but you can really go with any
833.199 : length you want just look at the channel
835.0 : I showed you earlier all of their videos
837.399 : are anywhere from 1 to 3 hours long so
840.519 : there's really no limit to it truth is
842.759 : longer videos perform better on YouTube
845.079 : let me give you an example you have two
847.079 : channels that post the exact same
849.279 : quality videos they're the same length
851.88 : topics everything is identical if one of
854.639 : them would actually post videos where
856.6 : everything is still the same but the
858.519 : length of the content is way longer than
861.04 : the competitor the channel posting the
862.839 : longer videos would win in the long run
865.24 : this is a crucial concept to understand
867.48 : when looking at how to overtake
869.24 : competitive Niche so yeah click on
871.279 : generate and in a couple of seconds tube
873.519 : magic will write the entire script for
875.48 : you I just want to make it clear before
877.16 : I show you the results from tube magic
879.16 : if you have the time write the scripts
881.079 : yourself if you learn how a viral script
883.199 : is built it will help you so much I
885.8 : really mean it just analyze how the
887.44 : competitors write their scripts and try
889.279 : to write them yourself the first one's
891.079 : going to suck but we're in this for the
892.68 : long run anyways tube magic scripts
895.88 : usually you don't have to spend a lot of
897.36 : time editing them but it's still
899.04 : recommend you read it through a couple
900.44 : of times just to make sure everything
902.079 : looks good after reading it through I
904.12 : thought the hook was a bit too formal
906.04 : and boring so I'll make changes to this
908.16 : first paragraph the hook is really what
910.36 : will make or break your video so it
912.199 : needs to be engaging without a good hook
914.839 : the viewer might leave your video early
916.839 : resulting in YouTube thinking your video
918.88 : is just pure crap but since we can't
921.399 : edit the script inside of tube magic
923.399 : just copy and paste the script into a
925.24 : Google doc just go to the Google Doc
927.279 : website and open up a new DOC like this
930.0 : now copy the first paragraph and head
932.04 : over to chat GPT then you want to paste
934.6 : in this prompt that you'll find in the
936.319 : checklist document followed by the
938.079 : paragraph it'll rewrite the paragraph
940.48 : and make it more engaging now copy it
942.72 : and paste it into the script document
944.72 : just make sure you delete the old first
946.48 : paragraph and our script is done Chad
949.12 : what's up next hi Leo good to be back
952.199 : it's a big tutorial you're doing here
954.12 : right yeah we're going through
955.72 : absolutely everything there is to know
957.519 : about this stuff I see
959.759 : so you've created your script it's now
962.519 : time to generate a voice
966.44 : over I always use 11 labs for this since
969.519 : they have the most realistic voices and
971.44 : it's really cheap if you don't already
973.279 : have an account you can just sign up
974.72 : with your Gmail or Google account here
976.48 : on the homepage it only takes a couple
978.319 : of seconds then you want to click on the
980.279 : tab that says voices here you've got two
982.72 : options you can either go with one of
984.56 : their pre-made voices or you can create
987.0 : your own voice which generally is a lot
989.199 : better the thing is most of their
991.12 : pre-made voices have already been used
993.279 : millions of times and people will have
994.959 : heard it before instead if you're
997.04 : looking to Brand your channel and make
998.759 : people recognize it you want to create
1000.759 : something unique for your channel and
1002.92 : it's really super simple to do click on
1005.319 : this button to the right that says add
1007.44 : new voice then press create new voice
1010.04 : and you'll be able to design it yourself
1012.079 : there's really no right or wrong here
1013.839 : you just want to create a voice that
1015.319 : fits your Niche since we're creating a
1017.319 : history documentary I feel like like a
1019.16 : male voice is a good choice for age I'll
1021.72 : go with middle-aged and the nationality
1023.92 : to American now experiment with accent
1026.36 : strength try generating it a couple of
1028.4 : times till you get one you like and hit
1030.439 : use voice then you name it so you know
1032.76 : which one it is and click on create
1034.88 : voice now to actually use the voice for
1037.319 : your content go to the speech Tab and
1039.72 : choose the voice you just created the
1041.72 : mistake I see a lot of people make is
1043.919 : generating the entire script at once
1046.36 : don't do this it can make the voice over
1048.4 : you gener sound kind of robotical and
1050.96 : we'd want to avoid that if possible
1053.0 : watching a video that sounds unnatural
1055.16 : and weird to watch will throw off the
1056.919 : viewer instead you want to paste in one
1059.559 : paragraph at a time so start off by
1062.12 : copying the first paragraph from the
1063.88 : script document and paste it into 11
1066.2 : Labs I wouldn't recommend you change
1068.16 : these settings here unless you know what
1069.88 : you're doing it can just end up making
1071.6 : your voice sound kind of weird as well
1073.76 : now hit generate speech and wait a
1075.799 : couple of seconds here you'll see that
1077.64 : your voice over has been generated and
1079.6 : you can click the little play button
1081.2 : here to preview it so listen through it
1083.24 : so that it sounds natural sometimes the
1085.48 : software is lagging and gives you really
1087.44 : weird sounding voiceovers it'll be a
1089.6 : pain in the ass if you realize that when
1091.52 : you've already edited your whole video
1093.88 : once you've confirmed it looks good you
1095.64 : want to click on this button to the
1097.48 : right and download it the rest is really
1099.84 : simple just repeat this process till
1101.919 : you've generated the entire script so
1104.4 : I'll just speed up this process and get
1106.039 : back to you when I'm done so now that we
1108.36 : have the entire voice over ready it took
1110.64 : me no more than a minute however the AI
1113.32 : generated voiceovers often have these
1115.6 : small unnatural pauses in them so
1118.28 : basically what we want to do is
1119.96 : Implement a little trick that I'll show
1121.559 : you in a bit it's actually really simple
1123.76 : so you don't need any special knowledge
1125.679 : what you want to do is open up cap cut
1128.08 : and create a new project now import all
1130.96 : the voiceover files by pressing the
1133.08 : upload tab here and just selecting the
1135.559 : file of the voiceovers then add them to
1137.799 : the timeline and make make sure they're
1139.4 : in the right order nothing too crazy
1141.799 : after that you want to click on this
1143.4 : button to the right and switch to split
1145.4 : mode now make Cuts like this every time
1148.84 : there's a silent moment one where the
1150.84 : pause begins and one where it ends then
1153.44 : just repeat this on the entire voice
1155.28 : over till you've cut out all the pauses
1157.6 : next select the silent moments you just
1159.559 : cut out hit the delete button and drag
1161.88 : the clips together like this now again
1164.32 : repeat this process on the entire voice
1166.6 : over till all the silent moments are
1168.4 : deleted by cutting out all the pauses
1170.799 : the video will get a higher pace and be
1172.799 : more engaging to the viewer like
1174.919 : literally every single Creator that's
1176.88 : big and uses an AI voice does this it's
1179.559 : the biggest engagement hack and
1181.159 : basically takes no time to do just
1183.24 : listen to the difference Japanese
1185.24 : Society if you enjoyed this Journey
1187.159 : Through Time Please Subscribe like and
1189.76 : share this video keep in mind though if
1191.559 : you are doing these historical videos
1193.6 : that are let's say 3 hours in length
1195.799 : this isn't really necessary this is
1197.64 : because the pace of the is usually super
1200.32 : super slow so It'll be just a big waste
1202.6 : of time to do this and to be honest it's
1205.0 : not really going to fit the nich's style
1206.88 : either this little hack is primarily for
1208.88 : shorter videos now click export in the
1211.559 : top right check the box that says audio
1214.4 : and uncheck the one that says video this
1217.08 : way it'll be exported as an MP3 file
1219.64 : which will make things a lot easier
1221.12 : moving forward so just name it and hit
1223.52 : export now the next step good job so far
1226.96 : Leo you've learned a lot since last time
1230.64 : yeah I know but you know I want to
1232.52 : create something really unique here
1234.559 : something none of the competitors are
1236.039 : doing have any ideas Chad so I looked
1238.919 : through your character analysis and
1241.36 : something I noticed was that neither of
1243.32 : them have a character which is something
1245.52 : that has been proven to work for lots of
1247.32 : faceless channels so your advice is you
1250.919 : should create a unique character for
1252.88 : each video that's all I can tell you the
1255.559 : rest you got to figure out yourself
1261.08 : faceless YouTube channels with a
1262.96 : character have been proven to perform
1264.64 : really well I mean just look at mine
1267.12 : also I noticed that almost no other
1269.159 : channels in our Niche are doing this so
1271.0 : it'll absolutely give us a competitive
1273.12 : Advantage it's also a really big thing
1275.52 : if you want to Brand your channel more
1277.559 : at least in my opinion you should always
1279.799 : brand your channel if your audience
1281.88 : recognizes your channel through a
1283.48 : character it'll be much easier later on
1285.76 : to build an actual brand and sell
1288.08 : products once your channel is
1289.72 : established now this is just in general
1292.2 : for the example here I will only
1294.12 : generate a character that we'll use in
1296.039 : this specific video cuz it's more
1297.72 : engaging to watch I'll do this part in
1300.0 : Leonardo AI so to start off you want to
1302.559 : head over to chat GPT and use yet
1304.799 : another prompt I've already prepared it
1307.039 : you'll find it in the Google Doc we're
1309.039 : basically asking chat GPT to generate a
1311.799 : design idea for an older Japanese
1314.12 : character since the topic is the entire
1316.44 : history of Japan this prompt probably
1318.76 : won't be useful for you unless you're
1320.24 : creating a Japan related video but it's
1322.559 : good to have some inspiration when you
1324.12 : write your own basically you just want
1326.48 : to create a character with a connection
1328.44 : to your topic when you get your prompt
1330.44 : ready hit generate and ask it to turn
1332.88 : the design idea into a text prompt that
1335.12 : can be used in Leonardo AI now copy The
1337.84 : Prompt and head over to Leonardo AI
1340.2 : before we generate it you want to make
1341.799 : sure you've set the image Dimensions to
1344.4 : 169 I also recommend you set the number
1346.919 : of images to four so you have a couple
1348.76 : to choose from now hit generate and wait
1351.039 : a couple of seconds for the images to
1352.6 : load they're all looking really cool but
1355.159 : I think this one is the best since the
1357.0 : person is looking straight into the
1358.6 : camera which will make it a lot easier
1360.24 : to animate so once you found one you
1362.44 : like you want to hover over the image
1364.52 : and press the button that says download
1366.48 : image now the next step is to animate
1368.96 : our character so that it looks like it's
1370.64 : talking which is actually really easy to
1372.72 : do basically we're going to insert the
1374.84 : voice over into an AI software along
1377.36 : with the picture we just generated and
1379.279 : the software will then animate our image
1381.52 : so that it looks like our character is
1382.919 : the one saying it to do this you want to
1384.919 : head over to this website called did and
1387.76 : if you want your character to be talking
1389.64 : you'll need to invest some money into
1391.08 : getting a subscription here they have a
1392.919 : free plan but when you try to export it
1394.919 : they'll throw water marks all over the
1396.84 : screen which just looks really terrible
1399.52 : I'm on their light plan which has worked
1401.2 : well for me but if you're looking to
1402.799 : create longer videos you might need to
1405.039 : consider getting the pro or Advanced
1407.039 : plan also there's other websites like
1409.48 : hay Jen but for this example I'm going
1411.279 : to use did so once you've created your
1413.88 : account you want to click on create
1415.919 : video as you can see they have tons of
1418.559 : pre-made characters to choose from but
1420.64 : we want to use our own so click on
1422.679 : upload and upload the character we
1424.84 : created in Leonardo you'll then be able
1427.039 : to choose what emotions and movements
1429.32 : you want I'd recommend you stick with
1431.24 : natural as emotion since we're creating
1433.2 : a historical documentary next click on
1436.12 : script to the right here you'll be able
1438.24 : to to either paste in your script or
1440.2 : upload an audio file their voiceovers
1442.44 : are pretty bad though and since we've
1444.159 : already created our own highquality
1446.159 : voice over in 11 Labs that's the one
1448.24 : we're going to use so click on audio and
1450.88 : then upload audio now choose the 11
1453.48 : laabs file and wait a couple of seconds
1455.559 : so that it can be uploaded or processed
1457.64 : or whatever then you want to click on
1459.36 : generate video and it'll automatically
1461.76 : animate the image into a talking
1463.72 : character after waiting a couple of
1465.559 : minutes this is the result and as you
1467.76 : can see it looks really good now just
1469.88 : hit download and our character is done
1472.919 : the next step now is to generate all of
1474.96 : the images that will'll show along with
1476.679 : the character cuz if the whole video is
1478.88 : the character just sitting there and
1480.44 : talking it's going to be then you
1482.2 : might as well not upload anything at all
1483.919 : honestly we have to stimulate and paint
1486.6 : up the picture of our story more and
1488.64 : images are often a good way to do it so
1490.84 : the first thing you want to do is
1492.36 : generate text prompts again for this
1494.88 : I've actually prepared a prompt in the
1496.6 : document for you to copy that you can
1498.12 : use used for pretty much anything as you
1500.32 : can see we're telling chat GPT that
1502.52 : we're going to play a game where chat
1504.36 : GPT is my prompt generator then we tell
1507.08 : it to turn each paragraph of our script
1509.48 : into five different text prompts that
1511.6 : match the story line so first you want
1513.84 : to copy this prompt paste it into chat
1516.0 : GPT and generate it next you want to
1518.52 : open up the script document copy the
1520.559 : first paragraph and paste it into chat
1522.679 : GPT it'll then give you five detailed
1525.44 : prompts we can use in Leonardo but
1527.52 : before we start generating them in
1528.96 : Leonardo you want to repeat this process
1531.12 : till you have a full conversation like
1533.2 : this with prompts for the entire script
1535.36 : so I'll just speed up this process and
1537.08 : get back to you when I'm
1538.11 : [Music]
1547.08 : done okay so I've generated prompts for
1550.08 : the entire script this means we can
1552.24 : actually head over to Leonardo again and
1554.12 : start generating I'm on their $12 a
1556.48 : month plan which is really cheap and
1558.559 : it's been enough for me but again if
1560.48 : you're looking to create these longer 1
1562.52 : hour plus videos you might need to get a
1564.64 : package with more credits once you're
1566.64 : ready on the website you want to click
1568.36 : on image creation before we start
1570.64 : generating though we have to change the
1572.44 : settings a bit to fit the vibe of the
1574.12 : video I'll use one of their presets
1576.08 : called cinematic Kino and set the image
1578.36 : Dimensions to 169 when it comes to the
1580.799 : number of images you can really go with
1582.6 : whatever you like I'll go with one but
1584.679 : if you have some credits to spend it
1586.399 : might be a good idea to set it to two so
1588.52 : you have a couple to choose from now
1590.12 : what you want to do is head back over to
1591.96 : chat GPT copy the first prompt and paste
1595.2 : it to Leonardo then you want to add the
1597.08 : words ultra realistic at the end since
1599.88 : that will make the result even better
1601.72 : now you want to hit generate and wait a
1603.36 : couple of seconds for it to be created
1605.64 : as you can see it looks good and has
1607.799 : that Japanese Vibe we're looking for
1610.039 : this is actually a good example because
1612.039 : now that we only want images in the same
1614.279 : style there's a really good feature we
1616.12 : can use to do this you want to hover
1618.399 : over it and click on this button that
1620.72 : says image guidance now click on image
1623.44 : to image and then confirm as you can see
1626.48 : the image will now pop up under the
1628.279 : prompt box as a reference image what
1630.799 : this means is that whatever image we
1632.72 : generate will have the same
1634.32 : characteristics as that one which really
1636.399 : helps when you want to keep the same
1637.919 : style throughout the entire video now
1640.24 : place the mouse over the image and set
1642.279 : the strength to 0.1 the strength you set
1645.48 : will tell the software how much guidance
1647.32 : it should take from the reference image
1649.08 : let's say we set it to 0.9 Leonardo will
1652.039 : then try to make it as alike as possible
1654.24 : while 0.1 will allow it to be a bit more
1657.24 : creative while still considering the
1659.159 : reference image so yeah now that you
1661.32 : know that it's time to get to work head
1663.36 : back over to chat GPT copy the second
1666.159 : prompt and paste it into Leonardo once
1668.72 : again we just want to repeat this
1670.559 : process until all prompts are generated
1673.159 : this will probably take a while so I'll
1674.84 : speed this part up slightly and get back
1676.6 : to you when I'm done
1682.039 : all right so I've generated all the
1683.76 : images and as you can see our lineup
1685.799 : looks pretty solid if we just keep the
1688.12 : images still like this it's going to be
1689.96 : a bit boring though don't get me wrong
1692.12 : it can work but Leonardo actually has an
1694.84 : animation feature so we can make them a
1696.96 : bit more engaging to watch so now we can
1699.88 : actually move on to the next step which
1701.88 : is to animate the images and this is
1704.36 : really the reason why I'm using Leonardo
1706.36 : instead of mid journey I don't think mid
1708.2 : Journey even has this option to use it
1710.519 : what you want to do is click on personal
1712.72 : feed and find the first image you
1714.76 : generated press on it and you'll see
1716.799 : this button that says image to motion
1719.12 : you'll then be able to choose how strong
1721.2 : you want the animation to be by setting
1723.32 : the motion strength if you set it to 10
1725.72 : it'll create a really strong movement
1727.48 : that I'll show you in a moment but
1729.0 : basically it'll just look really weird
1730.919 : and unnatural on the other hand if you
1733.2 : set it to one it's not going to do
1734.679 : anything at all so what I like to do is
1736.76 : set it to anywhere between 3 to five for
1739.799 : this video I'll go with four so to make
1741.72 : it easier for you guys to understand
1743.44 : what this feature does I'll generate
1745.2 : this image three times with motion
1747.039 : strength 10 5 and 1 here's motion
1750.039 : strength 10 then I'll do the same but
1752.36 : this time set it to five and lastly one
1754.88 : where I set the strength to one now
1756.96 : click on image creation to the left and
1759.2 : you'll see them being generated right
1760.88 : here these motion Generations can take a
1763.0 : couple of minutes so I'll just jump
1764.6 : straight into when they're done all
1766.24 : right cool all of them are now generated
1768.48 : so this is the one where I set the
1770.2 : strength to 10 and as you can see it
1772.36 : just looks really saturated and
1774.12 : unnatural so avoid having it this high
1776.84 : this is the one where I set it to one
1778.72 : and yeah there's almost no movement at
1780.679 : all now this is the one I put to five
1782.919 : which is what I'd recommend you do too
1784.84 : it adds this slight movement that just
1786.76 : looks really cool so repeat this process
1789.2 : till you've animated all the images I'll
1791.48 : for example go back to personal feed and
1793.72 : do the same thing with the second image
1795.919 : the rest is pretty self-explanatory so
1797.76 : I'll just just speed up the process and
1799.24 : get back when I'm done when you're done
1800.88 : animating all the images you just want
1802.679 : to download all of them to do this go to
1805.36 : your personal feed again and click on
1807.32 : the first image you animated you'll then
1809.24 : see this button that lets you download
1811.2 : the small video straight to your
1812.84 : computer you can click on this left
1814.96 : Arrow here and just download it that way
1817.0 : to streamline the process now that I
1819.279 : have all the animations downloaded we
1821.279 : can move on to the next step of creating
1823.08 : the video which is to find some music
1825.48 : there are two ways you can go about this
1827.64 : first one being that you have great
1829.399 : music skills and find music yourself
1831.919 : second one being you have no clue and
1833.96 : use the prompt I've put into the
1835.36 : document what you want to do is copy it
1837.559 : and paste it into chat GPT we're
1839.88 : basically describing the kind of video
1841.72 : we're creating and then ask it to give
1843.6 : us suggestions of music that would fit
1845.64 : so hit generate and it'll give you a
1847.36 : long list like this of music genres now
1850.159 : to find the actual music you want to use
1852.32 : some copyright free music website like
1854.44 : pixabay once you've opened it up you
1856.36 : want to copy the genre from chat GPT and
1859.039 : paste it into pixabay then you want to
1861.2 : listen through the songs till you have
1862.84 : enough to cover the entire video and
1864.799 : please dear God do not repeat any
1867.32 : soundtracks in your video it just hurts
1869.32 : to see when people actually do this your
1871.48 : viewers will catch on and just be
1873.08 : annoyed overall if you want to download
1875.2 : them when you found something on pixabay
1877.159 : you just want to click on this button to
1879.0 : the right and voila you now have the
1881.559 : background music to use in your
1886.12 : videos once you have them down
1887.919 : downloaded we can move on to the final
1889.639 : boss of editing of course it's time we
1891.799 : put all of this together and actually
1893.559 : create our documentary video now I'll do
1896.08 : this part in cap cut but if you're used
1897.799 : to using another editing software like
1899.84 : Premiere Pro or Final Cut Pro that works
1902.24 : just as fine the reason I'm using cap
1904.24 : cut is mostly because it's free but it
1906.2 : also has tons of pre-made features that
1908.2 : makes the editing process a whole lot
1909.96 : easier what we want to do here is have
1912.039 : the animated images go on through the
1914.08 : entire video then we want to crop out
1916.44 : the character and put him on the side of
1918.399 : the screen so he's always visible so
1920.72 : once you've opened up cap cut click on
1922.799 : import and upload all the footage I'll
1925.159 : start off by importing the character
1926.88 : video followed by all the visuals then
1928.919 : you want to select all the visuals and
1930.679 : drag them to the timeline like this
1933.039 : again as with the voice over make sure
1934.96 : they're in the right order leaving it
1936.679 : like this with a sharp cut between the
1938.72 : clips makes it a bit annoying to look at
1940.84 : so to make it smoother we can add some
1942.6 : transitions what you want to do is click
1944.559 : on the button that says transitions in
1946.6 : the top left cut literally has hundreds
1949.639 : of pre-made transitions you can choose
1951.48 : from but you really want to go with
1953.0 : something smooth that's easy for the eye
1955.039 : to look at in other words not some crazy
1957.76 : transition where the entire screen is
1959.559 : spinning around in the document I've
1961.44 : included my favorite transitions which
1963.279 : are basically the only three ones I use
1965.36 : when creating videos like this the first
1967.399 : one's called blur just search for it in
1969.32 : this bar right here to find it then you
1971.24 : want to click on it and drag it between
1973.679 : the first two clips and as you can see
1976.0 : it adds this really smooth transition
1977.96 : that makes the clips blend together
1979.72 : really well the second one's called mix
1981.919 : which you don't even need to search up
1983.36 : you'll find it right under the trending
1985.039 : transitions same here just click on it
1987.72 : and drag it between the first two clips
1990.2 : if you want to you can add the speed of
1991.76 : the transition under the text that says
1994.039 : duration to the right I usually set it
1996.32 : to around 0.3 which I think looks pretty
1999.0 : good so I'll use this one throughout the
2000.679 : entire video the last one however is
2003.039 : called fade and you can just search for
2004.799 : it if you want to use it now adding each
2006.919 : transition between each clip would
2008.72 : literally take forever so what you want
2010.679 : to do is select the transition and click
2013.2 : on the button to the right that says
2015.24 : apply to all this way the same
2017.44 : transition will be added automatically
2019.44 : between all the clips which saves you
2021.399 : lots of time Pro tip from me to you next
2024.24 : you want to drag the character video to
2026.039 : the timeline and place it above the
2027.88 : visuals as you can see the character
2030.32 : video and the voice over is longer than
2032.399 : the visuals to fix this we'll need to
2034.519 : duplicate some of the visuals to fill it
2036.519 : out I really wouldn't recommend you to
2038.36 : do this instead go back to Leonardo and
2041.039 : generate more images until you have
2042.72 : enough to cover the entire voice over
2045.0 : but if you have to you want to highlight
2047.0 : all the visuals rightclick and hit
2049.399 : create compound clip this will turn all
2052.359 : the visuals into one clip that we can
2054.679 : then duplicate so just hit copy paste
2057.56 : adjust it so that it starts right after
2059.639 : the first clips and trim it down so that
2061.839 : it ends at the same time as the voice
2063.679 : over next we're going to mask out our
2066.0 : character this basically means to to cut
2068.0 : out a segment of the whole video which
2069.919 : in this case is the face of our
2071.48 : character to do this you want to select
2073.679 : the clip of the character and click on
2075.679 : the tab that says mask to the right as
2078.44 : you can see you have these shapes to
2080.0 : choose from I like to use the circular
2082.2 : shape so I'll just click on that and
2084.2 : it'll change the shape of the video into
2086.04 : a circle now you just want to adjust the
2088.44 : size of the video and place it in one of
2090.359 : the corners to change the size just
2092.879 : select the video click on basic and
2095.28 : change the scale I'll set it to around
2097.72 : 60 to 70% and place it in the upper left
2100.599 : corner the next step is to add Zoom inss
2102.8 : to the visuals which I'd say is optional
2105.0 : since the animation is pretty much doing
2106.839 : this for us but if you want to add some
2109.0 : extra Zoom inss you first need to select
2111.16 : the visuals rightclick and hit undo
2114.24 : compound clip which will basically just
2116.2 : reverse it into multiple clips then you
2118.44 : want to select the clip you want to add
2120.24 : the zoom into and click on basic to the
2122.839 : right next press this little square next
2125.4 : to the scale and set it to 100%
2128.28 : now drag the marker to the end of the
2130.079 : clip and set the scale to 140% we've now
2133.88 : added what's called key frames that'll
2135.839 : make the video go from scale 100 to 140
2139.24 : I don't really think this is necessary
2141.079 : since the animations look so good on
2142.8 : their own but feel free to do this on
2144.72 : all the clips if you want to the next
2146.96 : step is to add some effects or filters
2149.119 : if you want to call it that to do this
2151.04 : you want to click on effects in the top
2153.2 : left and search for one called noise 2
2156.119 : once you found it click on it and drag
2158.28 : it to the timeline extend it so that it
2160.599 : covers the entire video and place it
2162.72 : underneath the character as you can see
2165.119 : it adds this kind of retro filter that I
2167.52 : think looks really good on history
2169.24 : related videos feel free to experiment
2171.56 : around and add some other effects if you
2173.44 : like to but I'll just leave it like this
2175.119 : for now next we got to do some color
2177.28 : grading and no we're not going to do
2179.4 : some insane color grading so while you
2181.599 : editors out there watching this come me
2183.64 : some slack okay but click on adjustment
2186.359 : in the top left and then custom
2188.64 : adjustment layer this is basically a
2190.839 : layer that allows you to edit the tones
2192.8 : and colors of all the layers underneath
2195.04 : the adjustment layer start off by
2197.04 : extending it so that it covers the
2198.52 : entire screen then you want to move the
2200.8 : character above the adjustment layer
2202.839 : since we only want to change the colors
2204.56 : of the visuals select the adjustment
2207.079 : layer click on basic to the right and
2209.839 : scroll all the way down to vignette set
2212.119 : it at 20 which adds this Darkness to the
2214.64 : corners and puts much more focus on the
2216.92 : center of the screen now scroll up a bit
2219.52 : and set sharpen to around 20 to make it
2222.119 : a bit more crispy and this is really all
2224.599 : the color correction I like to do if you
2226.8 : know what you're doing feel free to add
2228.44 : some other adjustments but otherwise I'd
2230.4 : recommend you just leave it like this
2232.359 : next you want to add some captions which
2234.079 : is really easy to do just click on
2236.359 : captions on this bar right here and hit
2238.68 : generate cap cut will then automatically
2241.079 : transcribe the video and captions this
2243.92 : is also one of my favorite cap cut
2245.88 : features I don't even know how many
2247.64 : times I've used this usually it's really
2249.64 : good at getting a correct but I'd still
2251.52 : recommend you read them through to make
2253.119 : sure there's no mistakes once you've
2254.96 : read them through we want to animate
2256.839 : them to make them look a bit more
2258.56 : engaging so click on templates to the
2260.92 : right and you'll have hundreds of
2262.359 : pre-made animations to choose from many
2264.8 : of them you'll only be able to access if
2266.72 : you buy cap Cuts pro version but there's
2268.92 : still a few you can get with a free plan
2270.92 : so look through them and pick a template
2272.52 : you like since we're creating a long
2274.4 : form video I'd recommend you go with the
2276.48 : template that shows more than one word
2278.44 : at a time like this one these single
2280.8 : word templates are made for higher paced
2282.839 : short form content once you found one
2285.599 : just click on it and it'll be applied
2287.4 : throughout the entire video I liked the
2289.48 : animation of this one but I think we can
2291.359 : make the text look a bit better if you
2293.4 : click on this button that says basic
2295.48 : you'll be able to edit the look of the
2297.28 : text the first thing I'll do is change
2299.2 : the color of the text from yellow to
2301.28 : White I think that looks a bit more
2302.8 : professional then I'll go on and add
2304.92 : this glow effect and decrease the stroke
2307.079 : a little bit lastly click on this button
2309.92 : next to the text that says case and turn
2312.56 : all the captions into capital letters
2315.0 : this also just looks a bit more
2316.48 : professional for a history video done
2319.079 : good if you've been paying attention you
2321.28 : probably realize that we haven't made
2323.119 : any use of the music we downloaded
2324.92 : earlier so let's add that while we're at
2326.92 : it I think these soundtracks should be
2328.76 : enough to cover the entire video so
2330.68 : let's just add them one by one to make
2332.64 : it sound more smooth drag this little
2334.96 : dot to the right to make it fade in the
2337.44 : the number you see here is how long the
2339.119 : fade in will take I usually set it to
2341.359 : around 2 seconds nothing too crazy then
2343.96 : once again click basic to the right and
2346.28 : adjust the volume it's super important
2348.72 : to do this otherwise the viewer won't
2350.599 : hear the voice so I'll drag it down to
2352.8 : around minus 25 now add the second track
2356.24 : create a fade in and adjust the volume
2358.88 : basically the exact same thing as we did
2360.64 : on the first one then just repeat this
2362.76 : process again on the last track and
2364.68 : that's pretty much all the editing we
2365.96 : got to do pretty simple huh so the next
2368.16 : step is to export the actual video to
2370.359 : our computer click on export in the top
2373.0 : right and you'll be able to choose all
2374.599 : of these settings since the video will
2376.599 : be uploaded on YouTube you want to set
2378.599 : the resolution to 4K and frame rate to
2381.28 : 60 frames per second to get the best
2383.359 : quality hit generate and wait a couple
2385.52 : of minutes for the video to get exported
2387.56 : the longer the video is the longer the
2389.56 : export will actually take if it's a
2391.76 : super long video click export and go eat
2394.319 : dinner or whatever take a shower when
2396.8 : it's done just save it to your computer
2398.88 : and now it's time for the front end kind
2400.52 : of stuff the thumbnail creating viral
2403.2 : thumbnails is a video Topic in itself
2405.48 : but I'll show you my entire blueprint on
2407.24 : how to create thumbnails that actually
2408.88 : get clicks I'll go through everything
2410.52 : from coming up with ideas thumbnail
2412.839 : types branding and testing literally
2415.52 : everything that goes into it 9 months
2417.359 : ago I created this video today this
2419.48 : thumbnail has been clicked on almost a
2421.16 : million times and has been replicated by
2423.28 : hundreds of channels when it comes to
2425.119 : coming up with ideas you do not want
2427.319 : want to try to reinvent the wheel the
2428.92 : odds of you coming up with a new viral
2430.8 : thumbnail design that has never been
2432.52 : done before are pretty slim and just
2434.4 : going with a proven concept will
2436.119 : increase the chances you hit the gold
2437.68 : mine so just copy what already Works try
2440.16 : to find patterns in viral thumbnails and
2442.44 : replicate them remember what Pablo
2444.119 : Picasso said good artists copy but great
2447.28 : artists steal let me give you an example
2450.119 : lately I've seen this channel getting
2451.8 : hundreds of thousands of views per video
2454.0 : with these types of thumbnails fast
2455.839 : forward I started seeing multiple other
2457.96 : channels using the exact same structure
2461.0 : split the thumbnail into three images
2462.92 : and put a text over it and then I knew
2464.92 : it was a proven concept here's another
2466.96 : one this is Daniel dalen a couple of
2469.28 : months ago he started posting Vlogs
2471.16 : about work and lifestyle since then he's
2473.68 : gained 100,000 subscribers and millions
2476.24 : of views but his channel really popped
2478.4 : off when he started using this thumbnail
2480.16 : style basically just an image of him
2482.2 : with a text that says POV in the
2484.359 : background and now I see channels all
2486.4 : over YouTube copying this style and
2488.68 : again a proven concept so I thought I'd
2491.079 : use the exact same style on the
2492.64 : thumbnail we're about to create for our
2494.2 : own video the first thing you want to do
2496.119 : is head over to Leonardo AI again and
2498.359 : click on personal feed you want to look
2500.48 : through all of the images we generated
2502.359 : and pick out your three favorites the
2504.079 : reason why you want to go with three
2505.319 : images is because YouTube recently
2507.48 : released a split testing function that
2509.44 : lets you test multiple thumbnails to see
2511.64 : which one performs best but more on that
2513.72 : later now you want to download these
2515.56 : three images by clicking on them and
2517.4 : pressing this button right here then
2519.319 : open up whatever design software of your
2521.24 : choice I'll do this part in canva since
2523.48 : it's free and really intuitive but
2525.24 : Photoshop or anything like that will
2526.92 : work fine as well if you have some
2528.359 : experience already so when you're logged
2530.04 : in on canva you want to click on this
2532.28 : button that says create design here
2534.76 : you'll be able to find templates for
2536.4 : pretty much anything social media
2538.04 : related but you want to click on the
2539.72 : search bar and type in YouTube thumbnail
2542.72 : once it pops up click on it and it'll
2544.88 : set the right dimensions for you if you
2546.76 : look to the right you'll see they have
2548.44 : these pre-made templates but we're going
2550.4 : to create our own from scratch we're
2552.64 : original remember first things first go
2555.28 : to the left here and click on uploads
2557.76 : now press this button that says upload
2560.0 : files and find the three images we
2561.92 : downloaded in Leonardo once you can see
2564.24 : them in this bar to the left you want to
2566.2 : click on the first image and drag it
2568.079 : onto the screen like this as you can see
2570.359 : it doesn't cover the entire screen so
2572.24 : just drag out the corner like this till
2574.24 : it does since we're creating three
2576.119 : different thumbnails you want to click
2577.8 : on ADD page and do the same thing with
2580.04 : the other two images later on in canva
2582.44 : we'll actually save each page as a
2584.319 : separate file it's just more convenient
2586.359 : let's add the text first to do this you
2588.48 : want to click on text in this bar to the
2591.119 : left and then on heading the thumbnail I
2593.8 : mentioned earlier that we're going to
2595.119 : replicate has this text that says POV
2598.079 : behind a person or an object it might
2600.44 : seem complicated at first but it's
2602.2 : actually really easy to do start off by
2604.48 : clicking on the text box and type in p
2607.119 : POV the idea here is that we're going to
2609.64 : make the text really big and put it
2612.16 : behind the Samurai warrior to put the
2614.319 : text behind him we'll first have to
2616.28 : remove the image background what you
2618.2 : want to do is click edit image and then
2620.88 : on BG remover then let it load for a
2623.72 : couple of seconds and as you can see
2625.559 : It'll remove everything except for the
2627.44 : Samurai warrior now you want to click on
2629.559 : uploads and add the exact same image
2631.92 : with the background and put it behind
2633.96 : the cropped image you can make sure it's
2635.92 : behind it by right clicking on it go
2638.24 : down to layer and press send to back
2641.52 : then adjust the size so that it covers
2643.4 : the entire screen as you can see you
2645.52 : don't even notice the cropped out
2647.04 : version is there to put the text behind
2649.119 : the cropped image you again want to
2651.079 : right click on it go to layer and hit
2653.92 : send backward this way the text will be
2656.599 : placed between the cropped image and the
2658.76 : background image and as you can see the
2660.88 : text will now appear behind him now I'll
2663.359 : just adjust the sides of it and make it
2665.28 : really big by dragging out the Cor
2667.079 : Corners like this to make it clear what
2669.16 : the video is about I think it would be a
2671.119 : good idea to add another text saying
2673.359 : history of Japan or something like that
2675.599 : so I'll again click on text and add
2677.68 : another heading then I'll write history
2679.88 : of Japan and click on this button above
2681.96 : it to turn it into capital letters now
2684.2 : adjust the size so that it has the same
2686.119 : width as the POV text box to make the
2688.8 : text Pop a bit more let's add some kind
2690.839 : of effect to do this you want to select
2693.319 : the text box click on effects and you'll
2696.119 : have a few styles to choose from I
2698.04 : really like the neon effect so I'll just
2699.839 : click on it and it'll be added to the
2701.52 : text now just repeat this process on the
2703.8 : other text box I think it turned out
2705.76 : really good like this so we can just
2707.4 : repeat the exact same process on the
2709.44 : other two images and we'll have three
2711.64 : different thumbnails to split test like
2713.559 : a true YouTube Pro okay so I've designed
2716.4 : the three versions of it and as you can
2718.16 : see they look really good but before we
2720.48 : download them I thought it'd be a good
2722.119 : idea to add another color to the POV
2724.44 : text to do this you want to select the
2726.52 : POV text and click on this button
2729.04 : that'll let you change the text to any
2730.92 : color you want I'll change it to some
2732.599 : unique color like pink to make it really
2734.68 : stand out repeat this process on the
2736.839 : other two thumbnails and we're ready to
2738.599 : export them if you want you can use
2740.599 : different colors for all the thumbnails
2742.319 : to see which performs the best but it's
2744.119 : up to you to download them just click on
2746.359 : share in the top right and then on
2748.839 : download I'd recommend you export it as
2751.04 : a PNG file to make sure you get the best
2753.2 : quality but sometimes YouTube requires
2755.319 : smaller files as the thumbnail so you
2757.319 : might be needing to export it as a JPEG
2759.92 : now click on download and repeat the
2761.68 : same process on the other two
2766.16 : images our video is created thumbnails
2769.0 : are done and all that's left to do is
2771.24 : upload the video a lot of channels just
2773.4 : upload the video without knowing what
2775.16 : they're doing and miss out on a ton of
2776.96 : views I'll show you the exact strategy
2779.2 : I'm using when uploading my videos to
2781.16 : come up with titles descriptions
2783.24 : keywords and even what settings to use
2785.52 : first thing you want to do is open up
2787.359 : your YouTube channel and click on create
2789.68 : in the top right then click on upload
2792.359 : video and choose the file you downloaded
2794.4 : from capcut coming up with titles
2796.64 : descriptions and all that stuff by
2798.079 : yourself is really hard so I like to use
2800.319 : vid IQ it's basically an AI software
2803.16 : that creates all these things for you in
2804.8 : a couple of seconds it's pretty
2806.319 : convenient so head over to vid IQ and
2808.599 : sign up for an account it's free of
2810.24 : course then you want to click on Coach
2812.72 : to the left in this prompt box right
2815.24 : here you want to describe your video
2817.24 : topic and ask it to give you a
2818.92 : description filled with keywords related
2821.16 : to your Niche hit generate and it'll
2823.319 : give you a topic description and
2825.24 : keywords now just copy it and paste it
2827.8 : into YouTube disclaimer though I would
2830.2 : always recommend you do look at
2831.92 : competitors and if they have any
2833.48 : specific proven title format and just go
2835.8 : with that but if not and you're
2837.48 : satisfied with the vid IQ title and
2839.44 : description just copy them go back to
2841.72 : YouTube and paste it in the different
2843.4 : fields since we used the word POV in our
2846.319 : thumbnail I thought it'd be a good idea
2848.2 : to do the same thing in the
2851.599 : title then once that's done scroll down
2854.4 : a bit till you find this text that says
2856.68 : playlist you always want to have your
2858.48 : videos inside of a playlist to make it
2860.28 : easier for the viewer to find your other
2862.04 : videos in this case if we created more
2864.68 : videos in the same Niche for example The
2867.0 : History of the United States it'll make
2868.72 : it a lot easier for the viewer to find
2870.559 : it if it's in the same playlist it
2872.48 : actually makes a bigger difference than
2873.96 : you think because if you find a video
2875.839 : you like often times times you just
2877.319 : continue watching the same stuff and
2879.28 : having a playlist will make it easy for
2881.0 : the viewer to just kind of continue
2882.839 : watching to create one click on create
2885.599 : playlist and give it a name I'll give
2887.599 : this one the entire history of click on
2890.2 : Create and it'll be added to our new
2891.88 : playlist then you want to press no under
2894.4 : altered content I know we're using AI
2897.04 : but we're not doing anything like making
2898.839 : it look like a real person is saying
2900.48 : something they aren't then you want to
2902.079 : scroll down to tags and here we can
2904.28 : actually just use the keywords from vid
2906.079 : IQ so go back to the vid IQ website copy
2908.96 : the keywords and paste them into YouTube
2911.319 : by adding these to our video we'll get
2913.2 : better SEO and show up when people are
2915.44 : searching for any of these words both on
2917.76 : Google and the YouTube search feature
2920.28 : it's also time to actually prepare for
2921.92 : the split test of the thumbnails to do
2924.16 : this scroll back up here in YouTube and
2926.76 : press the test and compare feature here
2929.359 : you want to upload the three thumbnails
2930.96 : we created in canva and YouTube will
2932.96 : test which one that performs best for us
2935.16 : automatically this didn't exist a couple
2937.24 : of months ago so we might as well
2938.839 : utilize it as much as possible While
2940.88 : others don't know what it is so click on
2943.119 : these plus buttons and upload each
2945.28 : thumbnail one by one let them load for a
2947.92 : bit and click done once you've posted a
2950.079 : couple of videos you want to start
2951.64 : adding end screens which are basically
2953.839 : recommendations at the end to watch one
2955.88 : of your other videos to do this you want
2957.92 : to click on end screen and you'll be
2960.04 : able to link your other videos so that
2962.079 : the viewer can easily move from one to
2964.079 : the next one now click on the tab that
2966.24 : says visibility and make sure it's set
2968.44 : to public lastly you want to hit upload
2971.119 : and that's pretty much all that goes
2973.0 : into it so now all you got to do is
2974.96 : repeat the same process and find
2976.76 : yourself a posting schedule you can stay
2978.64 : consistent with too there's really no
2980.88 : right amount of times you need to post
2982.44 : every week you just got to find what
2984.119 : works for you I try to stick to one
2986.16 : video a week but if you can do more than
2988.28 : that that's also great the important
2990.04 : thing is you always prioritize quality
2992.359 : before quantity don't stress the process
2994.68 : only to post more focus on improving the
2997.48 : quality of each video and you'll see
2999.24 : much better results in the long run but
3001.44 : now on to the last part of this free

3015.44 : if you're interested in getting pre
3016.92 : monetized YouTube channels just check
3018.799 : out tick accounts in the description if
3020.72 : you actually use my discount code it
3022.359 : supports me a lot and helps me make
3023.96 : longer more in-depth videos like this so
3027.28 : how do you actually make money from this
3030.02 : [Music]
3032.64 : channel there are mainly four ways you
3035.0 : can monetize your Channel first
3037.04 : obviously being ad Revenue the money you
3039.079 : make from advertisers showing their ad
3041.04 : before and during your video the way
3043.0 : this works is that YouTube will pay you
3044.599 : an RPM Revenue per Millo this is
3047.359 : basically the amount of money YouTube is
3049.359 : paying you per thousand views and this
3051.799 : number can vary anywhere between 1 cent
3054.2 : to $100 depending on your niche what
3057.079 : you'll make is hard to know beforehand
3059.16 : but it all has to do with your Niche and
3061.48 : where your audience is from if all your
3063.559 : viewers are from third world countries
3065.4 : like India you'll have a pretty low RPM
3067.839 : but if your viewers are from First World
3070.04 : countries let's say the United States
3071.96 : you're more likely to have a higher RPM
3074.44 : normally you'd have to reach 1,000
3076.16 : subscribers and 4,000 hours of watch
3078.48 : time to even be able to make money from
3080.2 : this but honestly if you do this
3082.359 : correctly ad Revenue should be your
3084.44 : least profitable income source since I
3086.88 : started my channel 18 months ago only 5%
3089.799 : of my combined revenue is from ad
3091.599 : Revenue instead you should focus on
3093.64 : monetizing your audience in other ways
3095.88 : one of the most common ways channels are
3097.799 : making money outside of AD revenue is
3100.119 : from affiliate marketing these are links
3102.2 : in the description that lead to some
3103.92 : kind of product page and if someone buys
3106.119 : something through their link that
3107.599 : channel gets a commission for that sale
3109.799 : for example the links you see under this
3111.76 : video are affiliate links so let's say
3113.799 : you get a subscription on any of the
3115.48 : software used in this video I'll make a
3117.64 : small commission I try to only hook you
3119.599 : guys up with free websites but some do
3121.88 : require subscriptions so affiliate
3124.079 : marketing is a great way for your
3125.68 : viewers to support the channel while
3127.319 : they're buying something they would buy
3128.76 : either way it's a win-win now let's say
3131.28 : we wanted to affiliate a product for the
3133.24 : channel we've created in this video that
3135.28 : could be something like a history book
3136.96 : about Japanese history or literally
3139.16 : anything in that style usually it's
3141.2 : really easy to sign up for affiliate
3143.0 : programs most companies even have a way
3145.0 : to do it right on their website it's not
3146.799 : harder than that third way you can
3148.44 : monetize your audience though is through
3150.2 : private communities this is basically a
3152.48 : private group you set up through
3153.839 : softwares like school or patreon
3157.04 : your viewers will then pay you to be a
3158.68 : part of this private group usually on a
3160.72 : monthly basis and in exchange they get
3163.119 : access to stuff like courses exclusive
3165.44 : knowledge video lessons and giveaways in
3168.2 : this case with our History Channel we
3169.799 : could create a private Community where
3171.52 : the members get early access to videos
3173.599 : some kind of YouTube automation course
3175.359 : or literally a super niched group of
3177.319 : people very interested in history nine
3179.4 : times out of 10 there is always a group
3181.599 : of people that would be interested in
3183.16 : buying the most random things like
3185.28 : access to a private history group now
3187.72 : the last and probably most profitable
3190.2 : way to monetize your audience is through
3192.079 : digital products basically a product you
3194.799 : create once and can sell unlimited
3197.0 : amounts of times some examples of
3198.92 : digital products are editing templates
3201.2 : courses ebooks and stuff like that maybe
3203.76 : for this channel we could create some
3205.4 : kind of History course where we really
3207.44 : really dive deep into a specific
3209.16 : historical event it might be a bad
3211.119 : product itself but I'm trying to give
3212.48 : you the right way to think you want to
3214.24 : create a product that meets your
3215.92 : audience's demand something that saves
3218.079 : them time or solves some kind of problem
3220.04 : they have what you can do is look at the
3222.16 : comments of your videos and figure out
3224.16 : what your viewers really care about that
3226.119 : way and yeah that's the entire blueprint
3228.76 : from start to finish on how I create
3231.04 : monetizable faceless YouTube automation
3233.28 : channels we've gone through everything
3235.559 : from coming up with topics creating the
3237.799 : actual videos thumbnail design search
3240.319 : engine optimization and finally how to
3243.4 : monetize your channel if you got any
3245.52 : value from this video drop me a comment
3247.359 : letting me know what you want to see
3248.64 : next and of course press the Subscribe
3250.68 : button anyways that's it for this video
3253.2 : see you
