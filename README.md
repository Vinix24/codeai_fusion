# Code AI Fusion 
Welcome to a repo that explores the technology that enables you to 
use AI, code faster and learn how to automate your lifestyle.

I keep on learning new technology, packages and tools, and add the notes,
code and insights I collect under the fw_ex folder in this repo. You will find 
folders containing "spike" in its name. These folders contain the code and notes 
that are created from thes spikes.

The repo is a culmination of my learning, and I use this for making my youtube
videos. You can take look at [Insight Builder channel](https://www.youtube.com/@insightbuilder)
for the videos.

Feel free to fork the repo and practice the tech by modifying the code. You can also 
raise issues if you want me to address any errors. You can also start a discussion on 
some ideas or challenges you are facing when working on a particular technology in the 
discussions area.

**The pull requests are accepted** 
Yes the repo is a practice ground and you can raise pull requests on the code that I have 
written. I will review the code and provide feedback, and if useful and acceptable then will be 
merged into the repo.
