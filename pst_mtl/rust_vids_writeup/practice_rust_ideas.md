Practice rust to understand rust code

- Set up the IDE that can provide linting, code completion, code analysis and formatting. 

- 

- Enums, Structs 

- How impl is used to create methods to enums and structs

- How Traits club multiple methods, and allow different objects to derive the methods automatically, kind of composition

- Get familiar with Match expression

- How Options and Results work

- How the Errors are handled

- How the object types are converted between each other, and into String

- Different types of pointers and how pointers are used
  
  After that move to collections

- Vector and its methods

- HashMap and its methods
  
  Above two are like the list and dicts of python. Learning to use them fluently is important to understand much of the rust code
