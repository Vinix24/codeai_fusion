# How to Learn Rust when you are new to programming

Before finding out How, lets clear the **WHY** part of the question.

##### Top 5 Reasons To master Rust

0) Writing code in Rust gives a **physical experience** of moving the data inside your computer / network / system. Rustanalyzer provides the code completion, along with error checking. Clippy provides the linting support & rustfmt provides  auto-formatting of the code. 

> 1) **Instant  Feedback:** When there is error in code, the compiler throws error along with the best course of action to take to correct the error.
>    
>    What is Instant feedback?
>    
>    - Show example of the instant feedback in IDE
>    
>    - Show suggestion in correcting the error
> 
> 2) **Functions Barrow or Own:** Rust has a novel mechanism of Barrowing and Owning the variables' memory.
>    
>    What is owning the Memory?
>    
>    - Show variable assignment & memory allocation
>    
>    - Show how the variable moving out of scope means data also being removed
> 
> 3) **Automatic Memory Removal:** Variables in Rust code gets deleted from the memory, the moment it goes out of scope. Lifetime of the variables keep track of it
> 
> 4) **Everything is a Type:** Types controls the Data that enters the program, and what it can do inside it.  
> 
> 5) **Types Have Traits:** Another novel concept, where Traits are set of abilities that we can perform on the given Type. Traits can be attached on need only basis. Traits & Types make rust code easy for us humans to read and write.
> 
> 6) **Compiled Solution**: You can import 10 different dependencies, from different project. When code is compiled, all the dependencies are packed into one executable 

##### Presentation Idea:

1) Seperate md file for each presentation is created, and it is stored at **/codeai_fusion/pst_mtl/vidppt_markdown** 

2) Start the video showing the topic picture from the canva
