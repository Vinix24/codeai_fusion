## Instructions

### Step 1: Prepare the Dough
1. In a mixing bowl, combine glutinous rice flour and sugar.
2. Gradually add water to the flour mixture, mixing until a smooth and pliable dough forms. You may need to adjust water quantity slightly for consistency.

### Step 2: Prepare the Filling
1. If using red bean paste, ensure it's smooth and at room temperature.
2. For added texture, mix in chopped nuts.

### Step 3: Shape the Dumplings
1. Divide the dough into 15 equal pieces (about 50g each).
2. Flatten each piece of dough into a disk shape, approximately 3 inches in diameter.
3. Place about 1 tablespoon of filling in the center of each disk.
4. Carefully fold the dough over the filling and pinch the edges to seal, ensuring no filling leaks out.

### Step 4: Prepare for Steaming
1. Cut banana leaves into squares (about 8 inches) if using.
2. If using parchment paper, cut into squares of the same size.
3. Wrap each dumpling securely in banana leaves or parchment paper.

### Step 5: Steam the Dumplings
1. Fill a steamer pot with water and bring it to a boil.
2. Place the wrapped dumplings in the steamer basket, ensuring they do not touch each other.
3. Cover and steam for about 25-30 minutes or until the dumplings are translucent and firm.

### Step 6: Serve
1. Once done, carefully unwrap the dumplings.
2. Serve warm, optionally with a drizzle of sesame oil or a dipping sauce of your choice.

Enjoy your freshly made rice dumplings! They should have a soft, chewy texture with a delightful filling, perfect for sharing and satisfying for your guests.
