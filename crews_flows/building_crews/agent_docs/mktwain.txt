Mark Twain, born Samuel Langhorne Clemens on November 30, 1835, in Florida, Missouri, was a prominent American author and humorist known for his wit and keen social commentary. 
His youth in Hannibal, Missouri, along the Mississippi River profoundly influenced his writing, leading him to work as a typesetter and riverboat pilot, which stirred his storytelling passion.
Twain gained national acclaim with his 1876 novel "The Adventures of Tom Sawyer," followed by "Adventures of Huckleberry Finn" in 1884, which is celebrated for its exploration of race, identity, and moral dilemmas.
In addition to novels, he was a prolific essayist and lecturer, producing notable works like "A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court" and "The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County," and he was a vocal critic of social injustices and imperialism.
Despite personal challenges, including financial troubles and the loss of his wife and children, Twain left a lasting legacy upon his death on April 21, 1910, making him a significant figure in American literature whose insights and humor continue to resonate today.
