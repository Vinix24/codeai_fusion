# UV package & Commands

- [x] Make a list of commands and what they do

  - [x] tested uv install python
    <aside>
    ðŸ’¡

    uv python find > lead to surprise of finding
    3.9 to 3.11 all of which are under

    /home/uberdev/.local/share/uv/python/

    uv python install 3.9 > installs in above path

    uv python uninstall 3.9 > deletes it from the
    path

    </aside>

    - [x] tested uv run

    <aside>
    ðŸ’¡

    uv run [example.py](http://example.py) > exec
    the script

    uv run â€”no-project
    [script.py](http://script.py) > ignores the
    pjt environment, doesnâ€™t take your OS environ
    also

    </aside>

    - [x] uv add tested

    <aside>
    ðŸ’¡

    uv add â€”srcipt [example.py](http://example.py)
    â€˜pandasâ€™ > this adds the â€˜pandasâ€™ on top of
    the script.py

    uv add pandas > adds pandas to pyproject.toml

    </aside>

    - [x] tested uv lock

    <aside>
    ðŸ’¡

    uv lock > just uv.lock in the folder

    uv lock â€”script
    [script.py](http://script.py) > has to add
    script.py.lock (ensure uv self update is
    executed)

    </aside>

    - [x] tested uv tree

    <aside>
    ðŸ’¡

    uv tree > provides dep tree on the project

    uv tree â€”script
    [script.py](http://script.py) > provide dep
    tree on the script alone

    </aside>

    - [x] Understand project structure

    <aside>
    ðŸ’¡

    uv init > creates the project structure

    uv sync > updates the .venv with the packages,
    however pip freeze shows all the packages in
    the system, which is not correct.

    - When executed â€˜python script.pyâ€™, if the
    package is not in pyproject.toml then it
    throws error
    </aside>
    - [ ] Understand how distribution works

    Python projects are typically distributed as
    both source distributions (sdists) and binary
    distributions (wheels). The former is
    typically aÂ `.tar.gz`Â orÂ `.zip`Â file
    containing the project's source code along
    with some additional metadata, while the
    latter is aÂ `.whl`Â file containing pre-built
    artifacts that can be installed directly.

    <aside>
    ðŸ’¡

    uv build â€”sdist > builds tar.gz build files

    uv build â€”wheel > build binary .whl file

    uv build > gives both into ./dist folder

    </aside>

    - [ ] Understandin entry points

    https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/projects/config/#entry-points

    <aside>
    ðŸ’¡

    [project.scripts]

    hello = "example:hello"

    uv run hello > will execute the hello()
    function

    </aside>

    > The above did not work, then a bit of
    > digging found below

    https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/projects/init/#applications

    The projects are created in a fashion to be
    packaged or to be used as app

    <aside>
    ðŸ’¡

    uv init â€”app testapp

    which creates the tree like below

    testapp â”œâ”€â”€ [main.py](http://main.py/) â”œâ”€â”€
    pyproject.toml â””â”€â”€
    [README.md](http://readme.md/)

    </aside>

    When you want the package like those you see
    in mcp servers

    <aside>
    ðŸ’¡

    uv init â€”package testpkg

    testpkg/ â”œâ”€â”€ pyproject.toml â”œâ”€â”€
    [README.md](http://readme.md/) â””â”€â”€ src â””â”€â”€
    testpkg â””â”€â”€ **init**.py

    </aside>

With the above understanding pushing to the pypi
is for another day altogether
